# Coding Challenge Backend

Your challenge is to create a Node.js server to serve as the (backend) API for the frontend part of this coding challenge.

In the end, you'll be able to send a POST request to this server with a JSON payload containing a URL and it will return important and relevant metadata from the site at the given URL, including the site name, title, description, keywords, and author.

Example:

```bash
# request
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://davidhartsough.com/"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/
# result
{"url":"https://davidhartsough.com","siteName":"David Hartsough","title":"David Hartsough","description":"David Hartsough is widely regarded as a happy human, drummer, developer, designer, wannabe psychologist/philosopher, and stuntman â€” more or less.","keywords":"david,hartsough,davidhartsough,human,drummer,developer,designer,psychologist,philosopher,stuntman","author":"David Hartsough"}
```
